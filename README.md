# Road to CWEE

In this repository I will upload the necessary scripts to solve the different modules of the CWEE preparation.

## Injection Attacks

Module that covers XPath Injection, LDAP injection, and HTML injection in PDF generation libraries.

### Blind XPath Injection

[BlindXPathInjection.py](https://github.com/daparicio8383/CWEE/blob/main/Injection%20attacks/BlindXPathInjection.py): script to map the whole XML document, in the context of a blind XPath Injection (not a time-based exploitation).

### Blind LDAP Injection

[BlindLDAPInjection.py](https://github.com/daparicio8383/CWEE/blob/main/Injection%20attacks/BlindXLDAPInjection.py): script to determine the value of an attribute, ina LDAP search filter, in the context of a blind LDAP Injection.
