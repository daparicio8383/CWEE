# CWEE
Scripts that I will be developing during the preparation of the CWEE.

## Injection Attacks

Module that covers XPath Injection, LDAP injection, and HTML injection in PDF generation libraries.

### XPath Injection

[BlindXPathInjection.py](https://github.com/daparicio8383/CWEE/blob/main/Injection%20attacks/BlindXPathInjection.py): script to map the whole XML document, in the context of a blind XPath injection (not a time-based exploitation).
